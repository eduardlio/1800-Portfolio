          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a third year UQ student studying my Bachelors in Information Technology. Although 
            I'm primarily a front-end developer, I have experience in Java, Relational Databases, 
            Algorithms &amp; Data Structures, and Project Management Practices (specifically, Scrum and agile).
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of this semester, I was the Tech Lead and Team Leader of team SHMEL for the course 
            DECO1800: "Design Computing Studio: 1". The nature of my career as a student has been a little 
            jumbled around; of all the "Design Studios", I completed DECO2800 first followed by, DECO3850 then 
            DECO3801, which will be followed by DECO3800 next semester. As a result, this course has allowed me 
            to put my development skills into a practice in a way that I never intended; to teach git, and a handful 
            of other tools to my first and second year team members.

          <h1>Project Overview</h1>
          <p>
            The idea of the project is to use the State Library of Queensland datasets to create an application 
            which uses such data in an interactive and meaningful way. The datasets included Photos of the soldiers 
            in World War One and photographs of various locations in Australia from the years 1914 to 1918. The task 
            was to create an application that would be able to focus, manipulate, connect and present the data such that 
            it wasn't just a few rows and columns. 
            
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence team SHMEL was created. The name was created with the laziest method of team creation known: 
            using the initials of every team member. Using the British Convict Transportation Registers, we embarked 
            on a journey to create an engaging web app ever known to high school aged students: "Convict Lyfe" 
            (later renamed to "Convict Life" for the more tame audience). 
            
          </p>
          <p>
            The Project was divided into three distinct sections A, B and C. Part A involved the exposition of the idea; 
            deciding what approach we'd start off with, who we were aiming at, etc. Part B involved the development of 
            lower fidelity prototypes such as paper prototypes and questionnaires. Finally, Part C was where the meat of the 
            code resided. Coding, debugging and late-night hacking sessions. This all resulted in the final product of 
            Convict Life.

          <h1>Part A: Team Formation, Design Pitch and Proposal</h1>
          <h2>Team Formation</h2>
          <p>
            Finding a good team is easy once you realise it's up to you to create a good team. The idea of giving any ounce of trust into 
            strangers to help you with a project can be daunting. It sure was, for this project but the sooner I started trusting them, 
            the sooner we could all start working together. 
          </p>
          <h2>The Pitch</h2>
          <p>
            Initially we all had different ideas: "I imagined it would be like this" or "I imagined it would be like that". The thing we agreed on was the 
            dataset we were to use: the <a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/british-convict-transportation-registers">British Convict Transportation register</a> from the SLQ datasets. Through lengthy 
            discussion, we finally came to two ideas:
          </p>
          <h3>The Warden's Dashboard (my idea)</h3>
          <p>
            The short version: An interface showing a visualization of crimes, sentence terms and ships. This straightforward idea had in mind the requirement of using the data. 
            The idea was to be able to sort through every single convict to find convicts, ships or sentences by any given metric for a futuristic warden who had somehow travelled 
            back into the early convict era of Australia. With influences of other interfaces loosely based on marketing analytics and SEO, I wanted something that would look cool 
            and was completely functional. 
          </p>
          <h3>A Day in the Life of a Convict (the other idea)</h3>
          <p>
            The aim of which was to give users the chance to view two different sides of the convict era: the convicts and the Indigenonus Australians. 
            As we further developed the idea, it was clear that it didn't use the data set thoroughly enough. As a result, it was discarded, 
            but only partially.
